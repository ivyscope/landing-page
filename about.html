                    <h3>Tian</h3>
                    <p>Tian enjoys tutoring SAT/ACT and met many high school students who are eager to learn more about college life. Generic campus tours often fail to give high school applicants a sense of what it is like living on campus. We believe current undergrads have the potential to play host and introduce college life to high school students in a personalized and genuine way, without the sugarcoating.</p>
