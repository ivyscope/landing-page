          <div class="story_words">
            <p>In recent years, many high school students are applying to more and more colleges at a time. We believe this indiscriminate strategy is counterproductive. Admissions officers like applicants who understand and fit the campus culture. Although colleges feature information online and organize generic group tours, we sense a huge market gap where high school applicants can experience college life firsthand by shadowing current undergrads. Our revolutionary 1-on-1 immersive tour experience will make choosing and applying to colleges more exciting and effective.</p>
