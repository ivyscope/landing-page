          </div>
          <div class="story_words">
            <p>Recently, high school students are applying to more and more colleges at a time. We believe that treating college application as a number game is counterproductive. Admissions officers like applicants who understand and fit the campus culture. Shadowing a current college student through her typical day on campus offers valuable insight into fit and campus culture. Our founders have personally been asked by family members and friends to show them around campus. Now we want to expand this opportunity to more people, so that everyone, even those not as well-connected, can preview college life firsthand through our 1-on-1 immersive tours.</p>
